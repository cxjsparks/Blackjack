# Blackjack

I love going to Las Vegas. Mostly I love playing live-action blackjack and video poker. For my final GA project, I decided I wanted to make an app to play blackjack.

For those who have never played, blackjack is a game of skill most often played against the dealer, along with 1-5 other players. The idea of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. If a plyayer gets 21 in one deal, a 10 or face card (Jack, Queen or King) and an ace, that's blackjack, which pays 1.5x the bet. The only time when it's not a winning hand is when the dealer also has a blackjack. If both player and dealer have blackjack, it's a tie, called a push.

The dealer deals out 2 cards per person, one at a time, face down, with the exception of one of the dealer's cards. If the dealer's up-card is a 10 or face card, he or she will check the pocket card to see if it is an ace, which ends the hand. Unless a player also has blackjack, everyone loses their bet.

Below are some general guidelines based on what card the dealer is showing:
