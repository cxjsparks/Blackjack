            <p>After too many years as a receptionist in a law firm, I decided it was time to make myself uncomfortable. How best to do that? Jump into tech!</p>
            <p>It's been challenging, probably the hardest thing I've ever done in general, definitely the hardest thing I've ever done career-wise. I cried, I laughed, and most importantly, I found a great community of which to be a part.</p>
            <p>For my final GA project, I decided to create an app to play Blackjack. Despite the fact that I was most frustrated and uncomfortable with React, I decided to challenge myself and use it, along with HTML and CSS, to create my final project.</p>
            <p>Enjoy the game!</p>
